<h1>Programming Manual: Inline Perl Sample 2</h1>
In version 1.4, "primitives" were included to allow inline Perl documents
to include entire files easily. For example, this block:
<p>
<code>&lt;perl&gt;&amp;finclude("/usr/local/htdocs/httpi/license.txt")&lt;/perl&gt;</code>
<p>
inserts that file into this document, like so (obviously the table
tags aren't part of it). If you have this sample inline Perl
file installed locally, the
directive will probably fail (but check the source for the error message, or
you'll miss it).<p>
<table border = "0" cellpadding = "5" cellspacing = "3"><tr><td bgcolor =
"#ffe0e0" align = "center">
<perl>&finclude("/usr/local/htdocs/httpi/license.txt")</perl>
</td></tr></table>
